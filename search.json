    "text": "Scoring the forecasts\nWe now summarise performance quantitatively by using scoring metrics. Whilst some of these metrics are more useful for comparing models, many can be also be useful for understanding the performance of a single model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn this session, we’ll use “proper” scoring rules: these are scoring rules that make sure no model can get better scores than the true model, i.e. the model used to generate the data. Of course we usually don’t know this (as we don’t know the “true model” for real-world data) but proper scoring rules incentivise forecasters to make their best attempt at reproducing its behaviour. For a comprehensive text on proper scoring rules and their mathematical properties, we recommend the classic paper by Gneiting and Raftery (2007).\n\n\nWe will use the {scoringutils} package to calculate these metrics. Our first step is to convert our forecasts into a format that the {scoringutils} package can use. We will use as_forecast_sample() to do this:\n\nsc_forecasts &lt;- rw_forecasts |&gt;\n  left_join(onset_df, by = \"day\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(.value)) |&gt;\n  as_forecast_sample(\n    forecast_unit = c(\n      \"origin_day\", \"horizon\", \"model\"\n    ),\n    observed = \"onsets\",\n    predicted = \".value\",\n    sample_id = \".draw\"\n  )\nsc_forecasts\n\nForecast type: sample\n\n\nForecast unit:\n\n\norigin_day, horizon, and model\n\n\n\n        sample_id predicted observed origin_day horizon       model\n            &lt;int&gt;     &lt;num&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;num&gt;   &lt;int&gt;      &lt;char&gt;\n     1:         1         9        4         22       1 Random walk\n     2:         2         5        4         22       1 Random walk\n     3:         3         5        4         22       1 Random walk\n     4:         4         3        4         22       1 Random walk\n     5:         5         5        4         22       1 Random walk\n    ---                                                            \n223996:       996         1        2        127      14 Random walk\n223997:       997         1        2        127      14 Random walk\n223998:       998         1        2        127      14 Random walk\n223999:       999         0        2        127      14 Random walk\n224000:      1000         1        2        127      14 Random walk\n\n\nAs you can see this has created a forecast object which has a print method that summarises the forecasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake 2 minutes\n\n\n\nWhat important information is in the forecast object?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forecast unit which is the target day, horizon, and model\nThe type of forecast which is a sample forecast\n\n\n\n\nEverything seems to be in order.

It is a generalization of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to probabilistic forecasts, where the forecast is a distribution rather than a single point estimate (i.e. like ours).\nThe CRPS can be thought about as the combination of two key aspects of forecasting: 1. The accuracy of the forecast in terms of how close the predicted values are to the observed value. 2. The confidence of the forecast in terms of the spread of the predicted values.\nBy balancing these two aspects, the CRPS provides a comprehensive measure of the quality of probabilistic forecasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKey things to note about the CRPS\n\n\n\n\nSmall values are better\nWhen scoring absolute values (e.g. number of cases) it can be difficult to compare forecasts across scales (i.e., when case numbers are different, for example between locations or at different times).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMathematical Definition (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor distributions with a finite first moment (a mean exists and it is finite), the CRPS can be expressed as:\n\\[\nCRPS(D, y) = \\mathbb{E}_{X \\sim D}[|X - y|] - \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}_{X, X' \\sim D}[|X - X'|]\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) and \\(X'\\) are independent random variables sampled from the distribution \\(D\\). To calculate this we simply replace \\(X\\) and \\(X'\\) by samples from our posterior distribution and sum over all possible combinations.\nThis equation can be broke down into the two components:\n\nBreakdown of the Components\n\nExpected Absolute Error Between Forecast and Observation: \\(\\mathbb{E}_{X \\sim D}[|X - y|]\\) This term represents the average absolute difference between the values predicted by the forecasted distribution \\(D\\) and the actual observed value \\(y\\). It measures how far, on average, the forecasted values are from the observed value. A smaller value indicates that the forecasted distribution is closer to the observed value.\nExpected Absolute Error Between Two Forecasted Values: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}_{X, X' \\sim D}[|X - X'|]\\) This term represents the average absolute difference between two independent samples from the forecasted distribution \\(D\\). It measures the internal variability or spread of the forecasted distribution. A larger value indicates a wider spread of the forecasted values.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nFirst Term (\\(\\mathbb{E}_{X \\sim D}[|X - y|]\\)): This term penalizes the forecast based on how far the predicted values are from the observed value. It ensures that the forecast is accurate in terms of proximity to the actual observation.\nSecond Term (\\(\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}_{X, X' \\sim D}[|X - X'|]\\)): This term accounts for the spread of the forecasted distribution. It penalizes forecasts that are too uncertain or have a wide spread. By subtracting this term, the CRPS rewards forecasts that are not only accurate but also confident (i.e., have a narrow spread).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst the CRPS is a very useful metric it can be difficult to interpret in isolation. It is often useful to compare the CRPS of different models or to compare the CRPS of the same model under different conditions. For example, lets compare the CRPS across different forecast horizons.\n\nsc_scores |&gt;\n  summarise_scores(by = \"horizon\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = horizon, y = crps)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"CRPS by daily forecast horizon\", \n       subtitle = \"Summarised across all forecasts\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand at different time points.\n\nsc_scores |&gt;\n  summarise_scores(by = \"origin_day\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = origin_day, y = crps)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"CRPS by forecast start date\", \n       subtitle = \"Summarised across all forecasts\", x = \"forecast date\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake 5 minutes\n\n\n\nHow do the CRPS scores change based on forecast date? How do the CRPS scores change with forecast horizon? What does this tell you about the model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CRPS scores increase for forecast dates where incidence is higher.\nThe CRPS scores increase with forecast horizon.\nAs the CRPS is an absolute measure it is hard to immediately know if the CRPS increasing with forecast date indicates that the model is performing worse.\nHowever, the CRPS increasing with forecast horizon is a sign that the model is struggling to capture the longer term dynamics of the epidemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIT histograms\nAs well as the CRPS we can also look at the calibration and bias of the model. Calibration is the agreement between the forecast probabilities and the observed frequencies. Bias is a measure of how likely the model is to over or under predict the observed values.\nThere are many ways to assess calibration and bias but one common way is to use a probability integral transform (PIT) histogram. This is a histogram of the cumulative distribution of function of a forecast evaluated at the observed value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInterpreting the PIT histogram\n\n\n\n\nIdeally PIT histograms should be uniform.\nIf is a U shape then the model is overconfident and if it is an inverted U shape then the model is underconfident.\nIf it is skewed then the model is biased towards the direction of the skew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMathematical Definition (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Case\nFor a continuous random variable \\(X\\) with cumulative distribution function (CDF) \\(F_X\\), the PIT is defined as:\n\\[\nY = F_X(X)\n\\]\nwhere \\(Y\\) is uniformly distributed on \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nInteger Case\nWhen dealing with integer forecasts, the standard PIT does not yield a uniform distribution even if the forecasts are perfectly calibrated. To address this, a randomized version of the PIT can be used (Czado, Gneiting, and Held 2009). For an integer-valued random variable \\(X\\) with CDF \\(F_X\\), the randomized PIT is defined as:\n\\[\nU = F_X(k) + v \\cdot (F_X(k) - F_X(k-1))\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(k\\) is the observed integer value.\n\\(F_X(k)\\) is the CDF evaluated at \\(k\\).\n\\(v\\) is a random variable uniformly distributed on \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nThis transformation ensures that \\(U\\) is uniformly distributed on \\([0, 1]\\) if the forecasted distribution \\(F_X\\) is correctly specified.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first look at the overall PIT histogram.\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"PIT histogram\", x = \"Quantile\", y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before lets look at the PIT histogram by forecast horizon. To save space we will group horizons into a few days each:\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  mutate(group_horizon = case_when(\n    horizon &lt;= 3 ~ \"1-3\",\n    horizon &lt;= 7 ~ \"4-7\",\n    horizon &lt;= 14 ~ \"8-14\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram(by = \"group_horizon\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  facet_wrap(~group_horizon) +\n  labs(title = \"PIT by forecast horizon (days)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand then for different forecast dates.\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram(by = \"origin_day\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  facet_wrap(~origin_day) +\n  labs(title = \"PIT by forecast date\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake 5 minutes\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the PIT histograms? Do they look well calibrated? Do they look biased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the model is biased towards overpredicting and that this bias gets worse at longer forecast horizons.\nLooking over forecast dates it looks like much of this bias is coming from near the outbreak peak where the model is consistently overpredicting but the model is also over predicting at other times.",

This can be useful if we are interested in the relative performance of the model at different scales of the data, for example if we are interested in the model’s performance at capturing the exponential growth phase of the epidemic.

    "text": "As we saw in the forecast evaluation session, different modelling approaches have different strength and weaknesses, and it is not clear a priori which one produces the best forecast in any given situation. One way to attempt to draw strength from a diversity of approaches is the creation of so-called forecast ensembles from the forecasts produced by different models.\nIn this session, we’ll build ensembles using forecasts from models of different levels of mechanism vs. statistical complexity. We will then compare the performance of these ensembles to the individual models and to each other. Rather than using the forecast samples we have been using we will instead now use quantile-based forecasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRepresentations of probabilistic forecasts\n\n\n\n\n\nProbabilistic predictions can be described as coming from a probabilistic probability distributions. In general and when using complex models such as the one we discuss in this course, these distributions can not be expressed in a simple analytical formal as we can do if, e.g. talking about common probability distributions such as the normal or gamma distributions. Instead, we typically use a limited number of samples generated from Monte-Carlo methods to represent the predictive distribution. However, this is not the only way to characterise distributions.\nA quantile is the value that corresponds to a given quantile level of a distribution. For example, the median is the 50th quantile of a distribution, meaning that 50% of the values in the distribution are less than the median and 50% are greater. Similarly, the 90th quantile is the value that corresponds to 90% of the distribution being less than this value. If we characterise a predictive distribution by its quantiles, we specify these values at a range of specific quantile levels, e.g. from 5% to 95% in 5% steps.\nDeciding how to represent forecasts depends on many things, for example the method used (and whether it produces samples by default) but also logistic considerations. Many collaborative forecasting projects and so-called forecasting hubs use quantile-based representations of forecasts in the hope to be able to characterise both the centre and tails of the distributions more reliably and with less demand on storage space than a sample-based representation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to ensembles\n\n\n\n\nThe aim of this session is to introduce the concept of ensembles of forecasts and to evaluate the performance of ensembles of the multiple models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSetup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source file of this session is located at sessions/forecast-ensembles.qmd.\n\n\n\nIn this session we will use the nfidd package to load a data set of infection times and access stan models and helper functions, the dplyr and tidyr packages for data wrangling, ggplot2 library for plotting, the tidybayes package for extracting results of the inference and the scoringutils package for evaluating forecasts.

How do the CRPS values change with forecast horizon?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the CRPS values change based on forecast horizon?\n\nAll models have increasing CRPS with forecast horizon.\nThe more mechanistic model has the lowest CRPS at all forecast horizon.\nThe more stastical model starts to outperform the random walk model at longer time horizons.\n\nHow do the CRPS values change with forecast date?\n\nThe more statistical model does particularly poorly around the peak of the outbreak but outperforms the random walk model.\nThe more mechanistic model does particularly well around the peak of the outbreak versus all other models\nThe more statistical model starts to outperform the other models towards the end of the outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIT histograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipReminder: Interpreting the PIT histogram\n\n\n\n\nIdeally PIT histograms should be uniform.\nIf is a U shape then the model is overconfident and if it is an inverted U shape then the model is underconfident.\nIf it is skewed then the model is biased towards the direction of the skew.\n\n\n\nLet’s first look at the overall PIT histogram.\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram(by = \"model\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before let’s look at the PIT histogram by forecast horizon (to save space we will group horizons)\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  mutate(group_horizon = case_when(\n    horizon &lt;= 3 ~ \"1-3\",\n    horizon &lt;= 7 ~ \"4-7\",\n    horizon &lt;= 14 ~ \"8-14\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram(by = c(\"model\", \"group_horizon\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_grid(vars(model), vars(group_horizon))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand then for different forecast dates.\n\nsc_forecasts |&gt;\n  get_pit_histogram(by = c(\"model\", \"origin_day\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mid, y = density)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_grid(vars(model), vars(origin_day))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake 5 minutes\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the PIT histograms?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the PIT histograms?\n\nThe more mechanistic model is reasonably well calibrated but has a slight tendency to be overconfident.\nThe random walk is biased towards overpredicting.\nThe more statistical model is underconfident.\nAcross horizons the more mechanistic model is only liable to underpredict at the longest horizons.\nThe random walk model is initially relatively unbiased and well calibrated but becomes increasingly likely to overpredict as the horizon increases.\nThe forecast date stratified PIT histograms are hard to interpret. We may need to find other ways to visualise bias and calibration at this level of stratification (see the {scoringutils} documentation for some ideas).",

Does it match your intuition of how this outbreak will continue? Is there another way you could visualise the forecast that might be more informative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forecast mainly predicts things to continue growing as they have been. However, some of the trajectories are going down, indicating that with some probabilities the outbreak might end.\nBased purely on the data and without knowing anything else about the disease and setting, it is hard to come up with an alternative. The model seems sensible given the available data. In particular, uncertainty increases with increasing distance to the data, which is a sign of a good forecasting model.\nInstead of visualising plausible trajectories we could visualise a cone with a central forecast and uncertainty around it. We will look at this in the next session as an alternative.\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to know how well a model is doing at forecasting, we can later compare it do the data of what really happened. If we do this, we get the following plot.\n\nfuture_onsets &lt;- onset_df |&gt;\n  filter(day &lt;= forecast_day + horizon)\n\nforecast |&gt;\n  filter(.draw %in% sample(.draw, 100)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = day)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.1, aes(y = .value, group = .draw)) +\n  geom_point(data = future_onsets, aes(x = day, y = onsets), color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Symptom onsets\",\n    subtitle = \"Forecast (trajectories) and observed (points)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake 5 minutes\n\n\n\nWhat do you think now of this forecast? Did the model do a good job? Again, is there another way you could visualise the forecast that might be more informative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the face of it the forecast looks very poor with some very high predictions compared to the data.\nBased on this visualisation it is hard to tell if the model is doing a good job but it seems like it is not.\nAs outbreaks are generally considered to be exponential processes it might be more informative to plot the forecast on the log scale.\n\n\nforecast |&gt;\n  filter(.draw %in% sample(.draw, 100)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = day)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.1, aes(y = .value, group = .draw)) +\n  geom_point(data = future_onsets, aes(x = day, y = onsets), color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  labs(title = \"Symptom onsets, log scale\", subtitle = \"Forecast and observed\")\n\nWarning in scale_y_log10(): log-10 transformation introduced infinite values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should be a lot more informative. We see that for longer forecast horizons the model is not doing a great job of capturing the reduction in symptom onsets. However, we can now see that the model seems to be producing very reasonable forecasts for the first week or so of the forecast. This is a common pattern in forecasting where a model is good at capturing the short term dynamics but struggles with the longer term dynamics.\n\n\n\nWe managed to learn quite a lot about our model’s forecasting limitations just looking at a single forecast using visualisations. However, what if we wanted to quantify how well the model is doing? In order to do that we need to look at multiple forecasts from the model.",
